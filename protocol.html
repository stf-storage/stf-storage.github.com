        <div class="span10">
            <p>An object is, from the client's perspective, a file or a piece of data, which is associated with a particular object URL.</p>
            <p>An object MUST belong to a bucket.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="span10">
            <p>A bucket is a logical group of objects. A bucket must exist prior to storing an object.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="span10">
            <p>An entity represents a physical copy of an object. While an object is a logical representation of a file/data, an object may be (and usually is) associated with multiple entities in order to ensure that the data exists.</p>
            <p>Entities are sometimes referred to as "replicas".</p>

            <span style="font-weight: bold">Dispatcher</span>
        </div>
        <div class="span10">
            <p>A dispatcher is the client-facing server which clients interact with. A dispatcher will handles client connections, talk to the backend storages, and serve the necessary data.</p>

            <span style="font-weight: bold">Storage</span>
        </div>
        <div class="span10">
            <p>A storage is a device which stores entities. It must be able to communicate with the dispatcher via HTTP, and handle GET/PUT/DELETE requests</p>

                        <p>Note that upon a successful object creation, you're not guaranteed to have this many entities in the storage: STF creates a minimal number of entities first, then asks the backend worker to create the remaining entities.</p>
                        <p>To control the number of object being created upon the initial object creation, see the X-STF-Consistency header.</p>

                        <p>If the dispatcher fails to create this many entities during the HTTP request, the entire operation is considered to have failed.</p>
                        <p>You may increase the number of replicas as much as you like, but note that increasing this number makes each object creation request take much longer to complete. It is recommended that you keep this value relatively low.</p>
